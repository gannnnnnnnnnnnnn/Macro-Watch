# Product Vision

## One-line Product

Macro-Watch is a local-first macro research terminal that connects market data, macro indicators, stress diagnostics, evidence cards, and future AI-assisted thesis validation.

## Product Thesis

The product is not a trading bot and not a broker terminal. It is a research workbench for observing macro state, transition signals, financial stress, and evidence trails. The goal is to help the user find, compare, and validate macro views with structured evidence.

The Evidence Library is the audit layer between raw signals and future AI analysis.

## Core Principles

- Local first.
- Evidence first.
- No fake scores.
- AI explains evidence later; it should not invent hidden scores.
- Generated/mock fallback keeps the app runnable.
- Small PRs, clear milestones, reversible architecture.
- Research pages should be useful before AI is added.

## Boundaries

Do not add broker execution, trading signals, hidden stress scoring, opaque AI conclusions, or database complexity until there is a clear reason.
